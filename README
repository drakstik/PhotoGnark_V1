# Introduction
This repo contains the source code of **PhotoGnark**, a Golang implementation of [PhotoProof](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7546506) that leverages the Gnark library to design zk-SNARK circuits.

# Pixels
An *RGB pixel* is an array of size 3, where each value is a number from 0 to 255 (1 byte). Each byte represents red, green and blue (i.e. [R,G,B]).

A pixel array can be *packed* into a 24-bit integer like this: `packed = (R << 16) | (G << 8) | B`; and packed pixels can also be unpacked into RGB pixels.

# Images
An image is an array of size N*N of *RGB pixels* or *packed pixels*.

# Image Transformations
Image transformations are functions that input an image and some parameters, and outputs a new image by changing pixel values.

# Permissible Transformations
A set of transformations are are defined as *permissible* by an administrator. This allows for administrators to create their own definition for *Image Authenticity*. For example, an admin can set increasing all pixels by a value less than 5 as a permissible transformation, which would mean that the image would retain its authenticity even if it is altered by increasing all pixel values by 3, however an increase of 6 would render the output image inauthentic, according to the admin.

An image is said to have a *permissible provenance* if it has undergone only permissible transformations. 

Permissible transformations can be made public by the admin or kept private.

# PhotoProof's Image Authentication
An image is original if its digital signature passed verification, using a verification key and a secure signature scheme.

An image *t_n* is authentic when it has a permissible provenance (*O,t1,t2,t3,...t_n*) that began as an original image *O*, captured and signed by a secure camera.

PhotoProof is an image authentication scheme that combines a secure camera, a digital signature scheme and the typical Zero-Knowledge algorithms commonly known as the Generator, Prover and Verifier schemes to assert image authenticity, as defined by an admin.
